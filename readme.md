# Algorithm Engineering Project
Engineering faster Binary search.

## Installation
First download and install [papi](http://icl.utk.edu/papi/software/index.html) (remember to run `make install` after `make`).

Then install gnuplot.

You are now good to go.

## Run
See the run_it_x.sh (where x is the name of the project and iteration) scripts to generate the output we used.

## Verifying the algorithms
Run the "Verify" target using CMake.

## Comparison and analysis
Put your run into `runs/<name of run>`, then run

    ./compare-graphs.sh <name of run>

The output should be in the same folder.
